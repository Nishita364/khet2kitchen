# Quick Test Guide for Disease Detection

## 🚀 Your Plant Disease Detection System is Ready!

### Access the Feature:
1. **Open your browser**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Navigate to**: Farmer Portal → Disease Detection
3. **Test the scanner** with any plant image

### What You'll See:
- **Disease Scanner Tab**: Upload/capture plant photos
- **Detection History Tab**: View past scans and statistics

### Testing Steps:
1. Click "Upload Photo" or "Take Photo"
2. Select any plant/leaf image from your device
3. Watch the AI analyze the image (2-3 seconds)
4. View results with:
   - Disease name and confidence score
   - Severity level (Low/Medium/High)
   - Treatment recommendations
   - Detection history tracking

### Demo Features:
- **8 Disease Types**: Randomly detects common plant diseases
- **Multilingual**: Switch languages to see translations
- **Statistics**: Track healthy vs diseased plant ratios
- **History**: All scans are saved locally

### Navigation:
- Look for the **Microscope icon** (🔬) in the farmer sidebar
- The feature is labeled "Disease Detection" in all languages

### Browser Compatibility:
- ✅ **Chrome** (best experience)
- ✅ **Edge** (full support)
- ✅ **Safari** (works well)
- ⚠️ **Firefox** (limited camera features)

### Next Steps:
- Test with different plant images
- Try the camera capture feature
- Check the detection history
- Switch languages to test translations

The system is currently in **demo mode** - it will randomly assign diseases for testing. In production, you'd replace this with a real trained ML model.

**Enjoy testing your new AI-powered plant disease detection system!** 🌱🔬
